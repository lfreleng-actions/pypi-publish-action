## Permissions

This action needs the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write  # IMPORTANT: this permission is mandatory for trusted publishing
```

## Implementation Details

Uses the upstream actions:

- [1password/load-secrets-action](https://github.com/1password/load-secrets-action)
- [pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish)

## Authentication Methods

Publishes using three different authentication methods.

In order of preference:

- [Trusted Publishing][Trusted Publishing] (Uses an OIDC token)
- Static credential retrieved from 1Password vault using a service account
- A static credential from GitHub secrets

Note: the first/initial publishing step cannot leverage Trusted Publishing

The first time a given repository gets published to PyPI, a static API key
is necessary. After this, setup trusted publishing for the project in the
PyPI web portal.
